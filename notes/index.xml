      <description>The Beneish model is a mathematical model that uses financial ratios and eight variables to identify whether a company has manipulated its earnings. It is used as a tool to uncover potential financial fraud. However, the result generated from beneish model can not be the evidence.
The variables are constructed from the data in the company&amp;rsquo;s financial statements, and once calculated, create an M-Score to describe the degree to which the earnings have been manipulated.</description>

      <description>Accumulation/Distribution Line (ADL)  The accumulation/distribution line gauges supply and demand by looking at where the price closed within the period&amp;rsquo;s range, and then multiplying that by volume. The A/D indicator is cumulative, meaning one period&amp;rsquo;s value is added or subtracted from the last. A rising A/D line helps confirm a rising price trend. A falling A/D line helps confirm a price downtrend. If the price is rising but A/D is falling, it signals underlying weakness and a potential decline in price.</description>

      <description>Java Features and Program Execution Java is a programming language and a platform.
Platform: Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has its own runtime environment (JRE) and Application Programming Interface (API), it is called platform.
Features of Java :   Simple:
 User friendly syntax based on C++ It has Automatic Garbage Collection It has Rich set of APIs Removed confusing features - explicit pointers, operator overloading, multiple inheritance, etc    Object-oriented:</description>

      <description>Bean Bean represents as an objects in Java. Bean need to contain the following points:
The Bean class The class attribute in bean is normally mandatory. The creation of bean object is through BeanFactory. It has three approaches.
The first approach is where the BeanFactory itself directly creates the bean by calling its constructor (equivalent to Java code calling new), the class attribute specifies the class of the bean to be constructed.</description>

      <description>Inverse of Control (IOC) and Dependency Injection Dependency Injection (DI) and inversion of Control are a design pattern. It allows the creation of dependent objects outside of a class and provides those objects to a class through different ways.
The basic principle is that beans define their dependencies (i.e. the other objects they work with) only through constructor arguments, arguments to a factory method, or properties which are set on the object instance after it has been constructed or returned from a factory method.</description>

      <description>JavaScript ES6 Overview ECMAScript is a standardized version of JavaScript with the goal of unifying the language&amp;rsquo;s specifications and features. As all major browsers and JavaScript-runtimes follow this specification, the term ECMAScript is interchangeable with the term JavaScript.
Syntax let and const  Variables declared with let and const are scoped to the block{ }, not to the function. Variables declared with let and const can only be accessed after they have been declared.</description>

      <description>Object Oriented Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies the software development and maintenance.
Class  A class in Java can contain: field(variable, attribute), methods, constructors, blocks, nested class and interface. Object is an instance of a class. There is only one way to define class in java using class keyword. The Object class is the parent class of all the classes in java by default.</description>

      <description>The java.util package contains all the classes and interfaces for Collection framework.
Map : An object that maps keys to values. A map is not ordered and cannot contain duplicate keys (but can contain duplicate values). Each key can map to at most one value.
Collection : A collection represents a group of objects, known as its elements. The JDK provides implementations of more specific subinterfaces like Set and List.</description>

      <description>Generic Classes A generic class declaration looks like a non-generic class declaration, except that the class name is followed by a type parameter section.
The type parameter section of a generic class can have one or more type parameters separated by commas. These classes are known as parameterized classes or parameterized types because they accept one or more parameters.
Syntax:
1 2 3  public class Box&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; { private T t; }   Box − Box is a generic class.</description>

      <description>Exception Handling in Java Exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program. It is an object which is thrown at runtime. The exception handling in java is one of the powerful mechanism to handle the runtime errors so that normal flow of the application can be maintained.
 An Error &amp;ldquo;indicates serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch.&amp;rdquo; An Exception &amp;ldquo;indicates conditions that a reasonable application might want to catch.</description>

      <description>String, in general, is a sequence of characters. But in Java, string is an object that represents a sequence of character.
CharSequence Interface: The CharSequence interface is used to represent the sequence of characters. The Charsequence interface is extended in three class namely String, StringBuffer, and StringBuilder classes.
String Class  By String literal  1 2 3  String s1 = &amp;#34;Welcome&amp;#34;; // This doesn&amp;#39;t create a new instance. String s2 = &amp;#34;Welcome&amp;#34;;   In the above example, only one object will be created.</description>

      <description>The java.io package contains nearly every class required to perform input and output (I/O) in Java. All these streams represent an input source and an output destination. The stream in the java.io package supports many data such as primitives, object, localized characters, etc. Java provides strong and flexible support for I/O related to files and networks.
The Hierarchy of I/O Class in Java Stream A stream can be defined as a sequence of data.</description>

      <description>Serialization in java is a mechanism of writing the state of an object into a byte stream. It is mainly used in Hibernate, RMI, JPA, EJB and JMS technologies. The reverse operation of serialization is called deserialization.
Advantage of Java Serialization : It is mainly used to travel object&amp;rsquo;s state on the network (known as marshaling).
java.io.Serializable interface : Serializable is a marker interface (has no data member and method). It is used to &amp;ldquo;mark&amp;rdquo; java classes so that objects of these classes may get certain capability.</description>

      <description>Multithreading in java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously. Thread is basically a lightweight sub-process, a smallest unit of processing. Multiprocessing and multithreading, both are used to achieve multitasking.
But we use multithreading than multiprocessing because threads share a common memory area. They don&amp;rsquo;t allocate separate memory area so saves memory, and context-switching between the threads takes less time than process.
Thread is executed inside the process. There is context-switching between the threads.</description>

      <description>Synchronization in java is the capability to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource. Java Synchronization is better option where we want to allow only one thread to access the shared resource.
The synchronization is mainly used to :
 To prevent Thread Interference (Thread interference is a condition which occurs when more than one threads, executing simultaneously, access same piece of data.). To prevent Consistency Problem (Memory consistency errors occur when different threads have inconsistent views of what should be the same data.</description>

      <description>JVM divides memory into stack and heap memory.
Stack Memory Stack Memory in Java is used for static memory allocation and the execution of a thread. It contains primitive values that are specific to a method and references to objects that are in a heap, referred from the method.
Access to this memory is in Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order. Whenever a new method is called, a new block on top of the stack is created which contains values specific to that method, like primitive variables and references to objects.</description>
