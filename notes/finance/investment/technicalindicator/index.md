# Technical Indicator


## Accumulation/Distribution Line (ADL)

- The accumulation/distribution line gauges supply and demand by looking at where the price closed within the period's range, and then multiplying that by volume.
The A/D indicator is cumulative, meaning one period's value is added or subtracted from the last.
- A rising A/D line helps confirm a rising price trend.
- A falling A/D line helps confirm a price downtrend.
- If the price is rising but A/D is falling, it signals underlying weakness and a potential decline in price.
- If the price of an asset is falling but A/D is rising, it signals underlying strength and the price may start to rise.
