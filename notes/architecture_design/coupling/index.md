# Coupling


Loose coupling within systems and between systems deserves serious consideration, because it has serious implications for design and maintenance. Achieving an appropriate degree of loose coupling allows you to spend more time adding new features and delivering business value. By contrast, tightly coupled systems are expensive to maintain and expand because small changes to the code tend to produce ripple effects, requiring modifications across a large number of interacting systems.
