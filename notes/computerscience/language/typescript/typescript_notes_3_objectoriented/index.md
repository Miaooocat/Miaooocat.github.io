# TypeScript Notes 3 Object Oriented



### Class in TypeScript

A class can include the following:

Constructor
Properties
Methods


```TypeScript
class Employee {
    empCode: number;
    empName: string;

    constructor(code: number, name: string) {
            this.empName = name;
            this.empCode = code;
    }

    getSalary() : number {
        return 10000;
    }
}
```


### Inheritance in TypeScript


```TypeScript
class Person {
    name: string;
    
    constructor(name: string) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

class Employee extends Person {
    empCode: number;
    
    constructor(empcode: number, name:string) {
        super(name);
        this.empCode = empcode;
    }
    
    displayName():void {
        console.log("Name = " + this.name +  ", Employee Code = " + this.empCode);
    }
}

let emp = new Employee(100, "Bill");
emp.displayName(); // Name = Bill, Employee Code = 100
```

### Interface

Class can implement interface like Java, but, unlike Java, interface can also extends class.

#### Class implement interface

```TypeScript
A class can implement multiple interface

interface IPerson {
    name: string;
    display():void;
}

interface IEmployee {
    empCode: number;
}

class Employee implements IPerson, IEmployee {
    empCode: number;
    name: string;
    
    constructor(empcode: number, name:string) {
        this.empCode = empcode;
        this.name = name;
    }
    
    display(): void {
        console.log("Name = " + this.name +  ", Employee Code = " + this.empCode);
    }
}

let per:IPerson = new Employee(100, "Bill");
per.display(); // Name = Bill, Employee Code = 100

let emp:IEmployee = new Employee(100, "Bill");
emp.display(); //Compiler Error: Property 'display' does not exist on type 'IEmployee'

```

#### Interface extends class

```TypeScript
class Person {
    name: string;
}

interface IEmployee extends Person { 
    empCode: number;
}

let emp: IEmployee = { empCode  : 1, name:"James Bond" }
```

### Method Overriding

```TypeScript
class Car {
    name: string;
        
    constructor(name: string) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    
    run(speed:number = 0) {
        console.log("A " + this.name + " is moving at " + speed + " mph!");
    }
}

class Mercedes extends Car {
    
    constructor(name: string) {
        super(name);
    }
    
    run(speed = 150) {
        console.log('A Mercedes started')
        super.run(speed);
    }
}

class Honda extends Car {
    
    constructor(name: string) {
        super(name);
    }
    
    run(speed = 100) {
        console.log('A Honda started')
        super.run(speed);
    }
}

let mercObj = new Mercedes("Mercedes-Benz GLA");
let hondaObj = new Honda("Honda City")

mercObj.run();  // A Mercedes started A Mercedes-Benz GLA is moving at 150 mph!
hondaObj.run(); // A Honda started A Honda City is moving at 100 mph!
```



### Data Modifiers

There are three types of access modifiers in TypeScript: **public**, **private** and **protected**.


#### public

By default, all members of a class in TypeScript are public. All the public members can be accessed anywhere without any restrictions.


#### private

The private access modifier ensures that class members are visible only to that class and are not accessible outside the containing class.


#### protected

The protected access modifier is similar to the private access modifier, except that protected members can be accessed using their deriving classes.
