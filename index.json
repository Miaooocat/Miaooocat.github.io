It includes JRE, Java compiler and other tools(such as Javadoc). In Eclipse, it can compile Java program without JDK, since it has its own version of compiler. Yet, Maven in Eclipse still requires JDK. JRE(Java Runtime Environment) refers to a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. It’s an implementation of the JVM which physically exists. JRE allow .class file to be executed. JVM(Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is a specification that provides a run-time environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. Our application is running on the JVM. JVM is often in an application server that deals with TCP/IP, HTTP, SSL protocol and so on.
