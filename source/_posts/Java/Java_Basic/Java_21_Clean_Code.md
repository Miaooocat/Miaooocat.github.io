# Commenting
* Should illuminate and explain 
* Should not detract, distract, misinform
* Often difficult to maintain properly
* Comments do not make up for bad code

## Good Commenting

1. Legal purposes: Copyright or authorship comments.
2. Warning of consequences: Ex. Not thread safe, takes long to run, etc
3. TODO comments: Reminders to do something that cannot be handled at the moment



## Bad Commenting
1. Mumbling
2. Redundant/Noise
3. Misleading
4. Mandated
5. Journal - Logs of changes to the code. Old practice
6. Nonobvious Connection - Not obviously relevant to the code it is next

# Naming and Formatting

## Indentation

# Module Organization
