# Software Developemnt Model
Software development model is a framework that is used to structure, plan and control the process of developing an information system.

### Predictive model
  1. Requirements are fixed
  2. Project is broken down into a predictable series of steps during design phase
  3. There is no business value during development
  4. There is a single delivery 
The simplest model that is cheap, but require clear expectation.
### Iterative: 
  1. Requirements are dynamic
  2. Involves breaking a project down into a number of iterations
  3. There is a working prototype resulting from each iteration (i.e. beta version)
  4. The result of an iteration has no business value other than to collect feedback from the client / users
  5. There is a single delivery

The purpose of iterative is to only get feedback from client, who could play some parts of the process, but software is only delieved once. This model often used for industry that has strict legal regulation such as health.

### Incremental
  1. Requirements are dynamic
  2. Involves breaking a project down into a series of increments
  3. The team identifies the MVP(Minimum Viable Products) and delivers a working product
  4. The goal of each additional increment is to add more features
  5. Multiple deliveries
  6. Each delivery has business value

Incremental Software Developemnt Model is to deliver part of fully finished project at each phase, which help to get return of investment shortly.

### Agile
  (Hybird of Iterative and incremental)
  1. Is a hybrid model that combines iterative and incremental approaches
  2. Requirements are dynamic
  3. Involves breaking a project down into time boxes
  4. The team identifies the MMF(Minimum Marketable Feature) and quickly delivers a working feature, but an incomplete product 
  5. The final product will grow from iteration to iteration until it is complete
  6. Multiple deliveries with business value
  7. Examples include Scrum and XP


## What is Agile?
Agile is an iterative process which focuses on the development team working in a flexible environment.  In this model the entire project team works in cycles towards demonstrable quality.

Agile techniques focus on the following characteristics
1.	A need for good communication throughout the project
2.	A need to adopte smaller, more easily managed iterations
3.	A need to be responsive to changing customer requirements
4.  A need to produce tangible results in a shorter time period that business can achieve a quicker return on its investment

## Agile Manifesto
The Agile Manifesto follows:
*	**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
*	**Working software** over comprehensive documentation
*	**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
*	**Responding to change** over following a plan

## Agile - Some of the Main Approaches
### Rapid Application Development (RAD)
RAD is a software methodology that uses minimal planning in favor of rapid prototyping. The lack of extensive pre-planning allows software to be written much faster, and makes it easier to change requirements.

The main focus of RAD is to develop and improve prototypes during each iteration.

### Lean
Lean is a paradigm: a rentless pursuit of adding value to customers while eliminating waste and continuously improving the process.

### Extreme Programming (XP)
Extreme programming is an iterative development process for teams centered around a number of engineering pratices. The most common of these practices are test driven development, pair programming, and continuos integration.

1. Test-Driven Development: Where tests for the software code are devised before code is written, and then the code is written to pass the test.

2. Pair programming: Where two programmers sit together at one computer and literally work on the same piece of code at same time. They might switch who is typing on the keyboard and who is watching, but they work together.

3. Continuous Integration (CI): Where developer working copies are merged together with a shared "main version" of the code several time per day. Continuous integration can be seen as an intensification of periodic integration advocated by incremental and iterative software development.

### SCRUM
SCRUM is an agile project management framework.

**Terminology of SCRUM:**
**Sprint:** A sprint (also refer to time-box or iteration) is a time period (3 week) in which development occurs on a set of backlog items to which the team has committed. Sprints cannot extended but they can be terminated if necessary.
**Backlog**: A prioritized list of requirements, user stories and tasks
**Product Backlog**: The product backlog is a list of requirements, user stories and tasks for work that has not started.
**Sprint Backlog**: The set of requirements that the team is currently working on.
**(User) story**: A feature that is added to the back log is commonly referred to as a story and has a specific suggested structure.
The structure of a story is:"As a < user type > I want < business functionality> so that < business value >" This done so that the development team can identify the user action and required result.
Example: As a trainer I want a white board so that I can draw diagrams in order to elucidate concept.

**Role of SCRUM:**
**Product Owner:** is accountable for ensuring the team delivers value to the business, responsible for **profitability and return on investment**. Product owner has authority to **accept or reject the work** that has been done.


**ScrumMaster:** Keeper of processes, removes roadblocks, fosters communications, serves the team shields team from external interference.
Scrum Masker is not the team leader, but acts as a buffer between the team and any distracting influences.

**The Team:** Cross functional (3-9 individuals) self –organising, makes task commitments, reports daily status

**Team Advisors: Pigs and Chickens**
**Pigs** are fully committed (Development Team, Product Owner, ScrumMaster) - can speak in the daily scrum 
**Chickens** can make contributions - active contributors in Planning and Review meetings – Users, Stakeholders, PMs

## Scrum Framework
### Daily Scrum Meeting
* The entire meeting is time-boxed to **15 minutes**.
Each person has about two minutes to describe:
"What did you do since yesterday's daily scrum?"
"What are you going to do today?"
"What might stand in your way?"
* It is the responsibility of the **scrum master** to remove barriers and impediments.  If this cannot be done during the daily scrum meeting (without the daily scrum meeting exceeding 15 minutes) then it must be done after. 

### Release Planning Meeting 
* During the release planning meeting the product backlog is defined and prioritised by Product Owner 
* Scheduled release dates are not planned in detail due to the flexibility of the framework
* A plan is defined which will give the release a broad direction and something for the team to aim towards
* Important that a definition of "done" is clarified

### Sprint Planning Meeting
* At the beginning of the sprint cycle, a “Sprint planning meeting” is held.
* The team members break stories into tasks with the scrum master facilitating. The product owner answers questions to clarify user stories.
* The team estimates how long each task will take.
* The team decides what items from the Product Backlog will be taken on in the next sprint and adds the items to the Sprint Backlog.
* Individual team members choose for himself/herself which item(s) he/she will take on for the next sprint.






### Sprint Review Meeting
* The Team demonstrates what they have accomplished during the Sprint to the stakeholders (a.k.a "the demo")
* The deliverable functionality is assessed against the Sprint goal to ensure that the overall objective has been met
* Both pigs and chickens are involved and can contribute
* Any **incomplete items** will be moved across to the **Product Backlog for reassessment**
* **Incomplete work** cannot be demonstrated
* **Four-hour** time limit

### Sprint Retrospective
* Team members reflect on the past sprint (pigs only, no chickens)
* Two main questions are asked in the sprint retrospective: 
  * What went well during the sprint? 
  * What could be improved in the next sprint?
* Determine if the Sprint Velocity was correctly planned.
* The Sprint Retrospective does NOT have an objective to assess individual performance.
* Three-hour time limit


## Scrum Artifacts
* Product Backlog
* The product backlog is a prioritized list of all the work yet to be started. The product owner is responsible for maintaining the product backlog.
#### DEEP
**Items in the Backlog should be DEEP**
**Detailed Appropriately**: User stories on the product backlog that will be done soon need to be sufficiently well understood that they can be completed in the coming sprint. Stories that will not be developed for awhile should be described with less detail.
**Estimated**: Items further down the backlog are not as well understood (yet), the estimates associated with them will be less precise than estimates given items at the top.
**Emergent**: A product backlog is not static. It will change over time. As more is learned, user stories on the product backlog will be added, removed, or reprioritized.
**Prioritized**: The product backlog should be sorted with the most valuable items at the top and the least valuable at the bottom.
